# My web-scraping projects

This is (most) of the code of my personal web-scraping Python projects.  
Feel free to use the source code to learn from, but if you borrow stuff, please source me.

Additionally, much of this code is aimed at scraping _particular_ websites. For example, 
if you the data from the website I scraped for the `manga_updates.py`/`manga_project` files/folder, please 
just help yourself to the data (`everything_json.json` and `everything_json_issues_slimmed.json`). Don't try to scrape
it again yourself---they don't need multiple people bombarding their site with this code.

If you want to see how it's done by running through the code yourself, please limit yourself to ~20 requests per run.
