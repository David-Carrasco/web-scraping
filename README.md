# My web-scraping projects

This is (most) of the code of my personal web-scraping Python projects.  
Feel free to use the source code to learn from, but if you borrow stuff, please source me.

Additionally, much of this code is aimed at scraping _particular_ websites, so please **do not start running stuff willy-nilly.** 
For example, if you want the data from the website I scraped for the `manga_updates.py`/`manga_project` project, please 
just help yourself to what I've collected (`everything_json.json` and `everything_json_issues_slimmed.json`). 

**Please do not try to scrape it again yourself---they don't need multiple people bombarding their site with my code.**

If you want to see how it's done by running through the code yourself, please limit yourself to ~20 requests per run.
