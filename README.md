# Update!

Hey to anyone using this! Starting April 2nd, 2020, I will be abandoning this repo for a private, forked version of it. Every so often, I might make some updates to this repo if they're general enough, but I'll probably forget to, if I'm honest.  There's still good stuff here, but I no longer want to deal with the hassle of constantly guessing what should be public and what should be private.

Thanks!

# My web-scraping projects

This is (most) of the code of my personal web-scraping Python projects.  Feel free to use the source code to learn from, but if you borrow stuff, please source me.

## Warning

This code is mostly for me. That means I'm still working on it, playing around with it, and I understand things about it that you, a stranger, may not.  Although I "try" to document things and be clear, do not assume any of the code works in the way that you think it will.


## Note:

Additionally, much of this code is aimed at scraping _particular_ websites, so please **do not start running stuff willy-nilly.** For example, if you want the data from the website I scraped for the `manga_updates.py`/`manga_project` project, please 
just help yourself to what I've collected (`everything_json.json` and `everything_json_issues_slimmed.json`). 

**Please do not try to scrape it again yourself---they don't need multiple people bombarding their site with my code.**

If you want to see how it's done by running through the code yourself, please limit yourself to ~20 requests per run.
